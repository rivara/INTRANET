<h1>INTRANET</H1>
<b>An intranet is a computer network for sharing corporate information, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services only within an organization, and to the exclusion of access by outsiders to the organization. The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses most of the same technology based on the Internet Protocol Suite.</b>
